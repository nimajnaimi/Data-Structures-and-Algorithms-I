* Info:
    - Assigned: 10/17/2019
    - Due: **10/28/2019 Monday 11:59pm**
    - Submission via Canvas
    - Your code will be graded on my Ubuntu Linux.  **Before** submitting your work, make sure your code works on this platform especially if you code on another platform like Windows. 
      Simple rule of judgement: If *make* does not produce an executable (compiler warning is ok) for that problem, it's considered as **DNC(Does Not Compile)** for this problem. 
      Starting from the next homework, you will loose **ALL** of the points for that problem if your code does not compile. 
    - Your work will be graded as following:
        - compiles: code should compile
        - correct: pass all tests, sufficient test cases
        - no memory leak: run valgrind on your executable and "definitely lost" should be "0 bytes in 0 blocks". **You will loose 5 pts** for memory leak in each of the following problems
       
The homework is in **UWB_CSS342_2019_Fall/class4/homework/**. 

Please follow the description of problem 1-3 in their own folders.
