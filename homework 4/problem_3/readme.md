## Iterative Possible Paths (40pt)

Use folder ```problem_2```.

### 1. (20pt) Implement possiblePathsIterative(int M, int N) in ***src/possible_paths.cpp***
```c++
long possiblePathsIterative(int M, int N) {
    // homework
    return 0; // place holder
}
```

This function return the number of possible and unique ways to go from the top left cell to bottom right cell in an M columns by N rows grid. One can only move either down or right at any point in time. This is the same example you see in class on 10/31/2019.

Unit tests are provided in test/unit_tests.cpp. They should all pass with your possiblePathsIterative(...).

### 2. (10pt) Create an account at https://github.com/ and create a new **public** repository

### 3. (10pt) Clean up your code and push your code to the new repository

To clean up your code, you should remove everything generated by cmake and make. Your files should look like this:

```bash
pdu:~/class6/homework/problem_3$ tree
.
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── googletest
│   ├── googletest-download.cmake
