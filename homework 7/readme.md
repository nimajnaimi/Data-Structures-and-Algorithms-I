* Info:
    - Assigned: 12/2/2019
    - Due: **12/12/2019 Thursday 11:59pm**
    - Submission via Canvas. 
    - Your code will be graded on my Ubuntu Linux.  **Before** submitting your work, make sure your code works on this platform especially if you code on another platform like Windows. Simple rule of judgement: If *make* does not produce an executable (compiler warning is ok) for that problem, it's considered as **DNC(Does Not Compile)** for this problem. Starting from the next homework, you will loose **ALL** of the points for that problem if your code does not compile. 
    - Your work will be graded as following:
        - compiles: **-5pt for code that does not compile**
        - correct: pass all tests, sufficient test cases
        - no memory leak: run valgrind on your executable and "definitely lost" should be "0 bytes in 0 blocks". **You will loose 5 pts** for memory leak in each of the following problems
       
The homework is in UWB_CSS342_2019_Fall/class9/homework. 

Please follow the description of problems in their own folders.

## Your Choice On Problem To Solve
__PICK and finish ONE (only one!!) of the problems between a search engine and sorting dependencies as your last homework. Here are some guidelines__:

- search engine: cool problem to solve, design your own, use smart_ptr, hash table, map, etc
- sorting dependencies: recursion, graph algorithm, topology sort, also cool problem to solve


## IMPORTANT INFO REGARDING SUBMISSION

The submission of this homework will be your github repositories urls to both problems. Similar to what you did in homework 6.

1. Track your homework with github repository. You can reuse your old one or create new one(s). Recommendation is put both problem folders (sudoku and dictionary) into one repo. OK to share with other code in this repo.

2. Clean up your code once you are ready to submit.

3. Send a text file via Canvas as you submission with the url(s) of your repo. 

4. No more updates after the due date. You will receive **zero** points if github shows you have newer updates/commits after due date and time.

The goal of this is to let you use git and github to track and backup your work. With this any dead machine incident will not be accepted as reason of late homework.
